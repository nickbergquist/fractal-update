## Browsers...

Javascript support is all modern browsers and for the MS stack Edge upwards but no legacy versions of Internet Explorer are now supported. 

## Including on a site

Obviously you need to include the core `vamscript.js` file.

Have a look at `components/_partials/_preview.html` within Fractal as an example.

## Linting

Javascript is linted via  ESLint using a modified version of the Airbnb ruleset. Before writing or modifying Javascript in this project it is advised that you read through the documentation around the rules
