# Links

## Background

## Implementation

Text link font size will match the font size of it's parent. Generally speaking though text links will either exist at `typeSetting(3, regular)` or `typeSetting(2, regular)`.

## Techincal information

Nb: The `HTML` for links with arrows should always be written on one line. If there is any whitespace at the end as a window is resized there is risk that the trailing arrow added by the `::after` pseudo-element becomes ophaned from the main link element. Removing all white space prevents this.
