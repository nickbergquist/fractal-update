# Modal

## Design notes

A generic modal popup, intended for broadcasting a call to action, e.g. questionnaire.

## Implementation

* Provide an identifier for the modal with the `data-modal-campaign-name` attribute.
* **Once Only** modals, seen once only by any user, require the data attribute `data-modal-once-only="true"` (only an empty value, or the absence of this attribute entirely will disable once-only).
* **Once Only** modals can optionally have a domain specified over which they must only be seen once. e.g. to cover subdomains `data-modal-domain=".main_domain.com"`
